- **Date:** *03-01-2026*


## 2. Introduction

- This test plan defines the **manual testing strategy, scope, approach, resources, and schedule** for the Cricket QA Automation Platform.
- The application is a **mock cricket information web app** developed specifically for **QA practice, defect identification, and automation readiness**.


## 3. Objectives

* Validate core functionality of the cricket web application
* Identify functional and UI defects
* Ensure correct handling of edge cases and negative scenarios
* Prepare stable test flows for automation
* Demonstrate structured QA methodology for interviews and CV


## 4. Application Under Test (AUT)

The application includes the following modules:

* Login & Logout
* Matches (Live, Upcoming, Completed)
* Players & Player Statistics
* Rankings
* Pagination
* Empty / No Data States
* Session handling and browser navigation control
